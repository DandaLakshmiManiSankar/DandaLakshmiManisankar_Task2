# What I did in my Task-2
# Task2_Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 

# 1.Summary Statistics
I calculated basic statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and range to understand the overall distribution and spread of the data.

# 2.Histograms & Boxplots
I visualized the distribution of numeric features using histograms and identified outliers or data spread through boxplots.

# 3.Feature Relationships
A correlation heatmap was used to observe how numerical features are related to each other, helping to detect strong or weak correlations.

# 4.Patterns & Anomalies
Through visual analysis, you identified trends such as skewed distributions and the presence of possible outliers or unusual values in the dataset.

# 5.Feature-Level Inferences
I drew basic insights and inferences from the visuals, such as which features vary the most, which may impact the target, and where data might need cleaning or transformation.
